The mountains are quite high; the highest point being Mt. Emi Koussi (about 3,415 m above sea level). The Sahara is blessed with two important rivers, the Nile and the Niger, which flow on the edges. The Lake Chad is the only freshwater lake in this area. There are a few freshwater oasis in the desert area as if to give respite from the hostile topography. An oasis is a depressed area where the wind has blown away the land, enabling the groundwater to come to the surface. The area around an oasis is fertile, where people settle down and grow different crops, including that of date palm. An oasis can be quite large, as that of Tafilalet Oasis in Morocco which extends over about __________ sq km.",

          "Being hot and dry, the Sahara is barren for the most part and is not suitable for vegetation. The few plants that grow here have long roots and waxy leaves, such as cactus, date palm, babool, and acacia, and a few other bushes. Flora is found near oasis, where date palms and other plants grow. Some farming is possible. To allow farming of fruits and vegetables, including figs, olives, apricots, etc., date palms are grown on the edges of the farms so as to create some shady area. Wheat, maize, millets, beans, onions, tobacco, and sweet potatoes are grown in large oases. It is quite amazing to know that the Sahara was once a lush green place where animal life thrived. Many cave paintings prove the existence of animal life here. There are many wadis here which were once rivers; these areas were home to several species of animals like elephants, lions, crocodiles, sheep, goats, etc. Unfortunately, it is now a barren land. Harsh and extreme climatic conditions have limited animal life in the Sahara. The few animals found here today include camels, hyenas, jackals, foxes, scorpions, snakes, and lizards.",

          "From the above discussion, you can imagine how hard the life is in the Sahara. People have to wear several layers of loose clothing to protect themselves from dust storms and hot winds. To keep cool, the houses have thick walls and small windows. The two chief nomadic tribes of this region are Tuaregs and Bedouins. They rear livestock such as goats, sheep, camels, and horses for milk and meat. Animal parts are used for making different things, as belts, purses, mats, blankets, and carpets, etc. A great change has come about in the Sahara after the discovery of minerals, especially oil, which has a great demand from all over the world. Other important minerals include iron, phosphorus, manganese, and uranium. Oil has brought prosperity to the region, which has resulted in founding modern cities. The number of nomads has declined now. The modern way of living has picked up. Good quality roads and multistorey buildings can be sighted in cities. There are many places of tourist attraction, especially the pyramids in Egypt. At the same time, this region is home to a disturbed political situation in many countries, such as Libya.

There are many high peaks here, Mt. Godwin Austen (K2) {8,611 m) being the world's second-highest peak. Dotted with several glaciers, Ladakh also has several rivers which cut deep valleys and gorges. The Indus is the most important river. Ladakh is connected with Srinagar by road and air. The Manali-Leh highway is a major tourist attraction for young bikers. Ladakh remains cut off from the rest of the country in winter months due to heavy snowfall and extreme cold. Whenever the weather is good, air service resumes.",

          "Extremely cold, Ladakh experiences temperature as low as -30°C in summers, while nighttime temperature in winters can go as low as -40°C. Located on a high altitude, the air is very thin. Due to this, a person sitting with some part in the sun and some part in shadow can suffer from both frostbite and sunstroke at the same time. Water freezes here as hard as ice, which is as good as no water. Due to this, vegetation is sparse; only some grasses and shrubs grow in winter. The condition improves somewhat in summer when glaciers melt supplying water to rivers. So, some crops of wheat, barley, and vegetables can be grown in the valleys. Apples, walnuts, apricots, and mulberries are also grown on a small scale. Harsh living conditions have led to limited animal life in Ladakh. It is a good sight to see some migratory birds, such as robins, redstarts, raven, Tibetan snowcock, etc. The chief varieties of animals include wild goats, wild sheep, and yaks here. These animals are used for milk, meat, and hides. Yaks are chiefly used as a means of transport.",
